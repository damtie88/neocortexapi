# Multi-Sequence Learning with Language Semantic

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Multi-Sequence Learning, specifically focusing on sequences of language semantics. The goal is to train a model to learn sequences from a given text file and predict subsequent elements in the sequence. The model is based on the NeoCortexApi and includes both Spatial Pooling (SP) and Temporal Memory (TM) components.
